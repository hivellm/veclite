# Changelog

All notable changes to VecLite are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Versions 0.x are pre-release: the public API may change between minors until 1.0.0.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **A crash during database creation can no longer leave an unopenable file**
  (SPEC-002 STG-053). The very first commit writes the gen-0 TOC before the
  header, and a brand-new file has no previous header→TOC chain to fall back
  on, so a process killed inside that window left a file with a zeroed header
  that failed every later open with `Corrupt("header: bad magic")`. Creation
  now materializes the initial generation in a sibling `-new` temp file and
  atomically renames it into place: a crash mid-creation leaves nothing at the
  target path. Found by the kill-9 harness (`cargo xtask crash`), which hit it
  on the Windows CI runner at iteration 0 — the window is a few fsyncs wide,
  so slow disks hit it hardest. Existing databases are unaffected; the format
  is unchanged.
- **A checkpoint with nothing to persist no longer grows the file** (task
  `phase6e`, SPEC-002 STG-052). Opening and closing a database with zero writes
  added a full copy of its segments each time — ~13 KB per cycle on a small
  collection, ~21.5 KB per idle explicit checkpoint, growing linearly. Every
  application opens and closes the database once per run, so a tool run daily
  grew its file daily with nothing changing, and a process checkpointing on a
  timer grew without bound while idle. The carry-forward mechanism existed but
  was keyed on the mmap base, so it only ever helped large mapped collections;
  an ordinary collection was marked dirty by its own load and never qualified.
  Collections now record the committed segments their state matches — on load
  from the TOC, and after each checkpoint — and a checkpoint with every
  collection carried forward and an empty WAL writes nothing at all. Existing
  oversized files need no migration: a single `vacuum` reclaims the space, and
  the format is unchanged in both directions.
- **The requested metric is no longer discarded when an embedding provider is
  set** (task `phase6d`). Creating a collection with both a `metric` and an
  embedding provider silently forced the default (cosine) and persisted it, so
  the collection differed from what was asked for and could not be corrected
  without recreating it. The root cause was an API gap rather than a slip in the
  bindings: `embedding_provider` is a private field, so
  `CollectionOptions::auto_embed` — which takes no metric — was the only way to
  build an auto-embed collection, and "auto-embed with a non-default metric" was
  not expressible at all. Affected the Python, Node and C ABI bindings, and
  through the C ABI the Go and C# ones; the Rust API was unaffected.
- **`search_text` no longer errors on a query with no matching terms.** A query
  whose terms are absent from the vocabulary embeds to the zero vector, which
  tripped the cosine guard in `search` and surfaced as `InvalidArgument: zero
  query vector is not allowed with the cosine metric` — an error naming a vector
  and a metric the caller never supplied, for what is an ordinary "nothing
  matched". `search_text` and the hybrid text lane now return an empty result
  set. **Behavioural change**: callers that relied on the exception must check
  for an empty result instead. The guard is unchanged on `search`, where an
  explicitly all-zero query with cosine remains an error.

### Added
- `CollectionOptions::metric()` — set the distance metric on options built by any
  constructor, including `auto_embed` (task `phase6d`).
- `CollectionStats::metric`, surfaced by the Python, Node and C ABI stats
  payloads. The metric was previously observable only by reading the file with
  the CLI, which is part of why the drop above went unnoticed (task `phase6d`).
- Prebuilt C ABI shared/static libraries (task `phase4e`, SPEC-008 FFI-030): the
  raw C ABI now ships as downloadable, checksummed release artifacts —
  `libveclite.{so,dylib}` / `veclite.dll` + static libs + the cbindgen
  `veclite.h` + `LICENSE` + `SHA256SUMS` — for the full FR-66 matrix (Linux
  glibc/musl, macOS incl. a `universal2` fat lib, Windows MSVC; x86_64 +
  aarch64). Shared libraries embed the shipped name (`SONAME=libveclite.so`,
  `install_name=@rpath/libveclite.dylib`, and a regenerated Windows import
  library referencing `veclite.dll`), so `-lveclite` resolves correctly
  everywhere. A per-platform C smoke-link (`ffi/smoke.c` + `ffi/smoke.sh`) links
  each shipped bundle with no Rust toolchain present and calls
  `vl_open_memory`/`vl_db_close` — the no-toolchain gate (REL-020) for direct
  C/Go/C# consumers. Header generated via `crates/veclite-ffi/cbindgen.toml`
  (the committed golden-file drift test is `phase4g`); per-OS download/link
  instructions in `docs/c-abi.md`. Wired into `veclite-release.yml`
  (`ffi-libs` / `ffi-universal-macos` / `ffi-smoke` / `publish-ffi-release`).
- Binding conformance corpus + packaging CI (task `phase4d`, SPEC-015 §3 /
  SPEC-016, gate G4): one language-agnostic YAML corpus in
  `tests/conformance/corpus/` (34 cases across defaults, every error variant,
  CRUD + scroll, filter semantics, hybrid rankings, auto-embed reopen
  determinism, chunker boundaries, and in-memory ≡ file-backed) executed by a
  runner in each binding. The **Rust reference runner** (`cargo xtask
  conformance [--bless]`, TST-020) defines the golden outcomes; a committed
  `golden.json` sidecar pins per-step scores and lossy round-trips (1e-5
  tolerance, TST-022) with a documented mutation guard (TST-023). Python
  (`runners/python/run.py`) and Node (`runners/node/run.mjs`) runners reproduce
  the reference exactly — orderings/ids exact, scores within 1e-5 — green on
  Rust, Python, and Node. Completing the surface so every op runs on every
  binding: sparse-lane `upsert` (Python + Node), `Collection.scroll` +
  module-level `chunk` (Python), `Collection.refit`, `Database.createAlias` /
  `deleteAlias` + module-level `chunk` (Node). Packaging CI authors the full
  FR-66 artifact matrix (maturin abi3 wheels + napi prebuilds across
  manylinux/musllinux/macOS/Windows × x64/arm64), a clean-machine no-toolchain
  install gate (REL-020) running `examples/quickstart.{py,mjs}` on Rust-free
  containers, and one atomic all-or-nothing release workflow (REL-012) with a
  TestPyPI + npm dist-tag `next` dry run (SPEC-016 acceptance 2).
- Node.js binding core (task `phase4c`, `crates/veclite-node`, SPEC-010): a
  napi-rs crate binding the Rust engine directly, mirroring SPEC-004 in
  camelCase. Every heavy operation is async by default (runs off the JS thread
  on tokio's blocking pool, so the event loop never stalls) with a `*Sync` twin
  (NODE-010/011). `Float32Array` crosses in for search/upsert (zero-copy on the
  sync path) and hit vectors come back as `Float32Array` (NODE-012). Failures
  reject/throw a single `VecLiteError extends Error` carrying a stable string
  `code` (`"DIMENSION_MISMATCH"`, …) and the exact Rust message (NODE-020).
  `close()` flushes and drops the handle so the advisory lock releases at once;
  later ops reject with `code: "CLOSED"` (NODE-013). TypeScript definitions ship
  and compile under `tsc --strict` (NODE-003). Seven behavioral tests pass
  (quickstart, error mapping async≡sync, event-loop liveness under a 4k bulk
  index, cross-process persistence + snapshot/vacuum, filters/hybrid/text). The
  prebuild matrix, `@veclite/*` platform packages, Bun/Node-matrix CI, the
  shared conformance runner, and external-buffer zero-copy-out are tracked in
  `phase4i_node-prebuilds-conformance`.
- Sparse-lane persistence + auto-embed hybrid + RRF conformance (task `phase3g`,
  SPEC-007): the hybrid sparse lane is now sealed as a SPARSE segment
  (`term_id -> [(slot, weight)]` inverted index), so a BYO sparse lane survives
  checkpoint+reopen and kill-9 recovery (sealed index merged with WAL deltas),
  and vacuum drops tombstoned postings (HYB-030/031). `LivePoint` carries the
  sparse component; load/load_based rebuild per-slot vectors from the segment
  (ascending term order keeps `indices` sorted). `HybridQuery::text(q)` fills
  BOTH lanes from one string on auto-embed collections (HYB-011) — the dense
  lane is the provider embedding, the sparse lane its non-zero components, which
  auto-embed collections now maintain and persist (HYB-002a). A committed RRF
  conformance corpus pins the fused rankings across alpha/lane scenarios
  (HYB-022). Note: VecLite standardizes on pure rank-based RRF; the server's two
  hybrid functions each add a raw-score term and disagree, so the corpus pins
  the deterministic SPEC-007 formula.
- Embedding lifecycle + custom providers (task `phase3f`, SPEC-005): the
  vocabulary now updates **incrementally** (`Embedder::add_document`,
  EMB-030) — `upsert_text` is O(doc) instead of triggering a full refit on
  the next search — and is persisted as a VOCAB segment at checkpoint, so a
  reopened auto-embed collection searches identically with **no rebuild and
  no re-embedding** (stored vectors byte-identical, zero tombstone churn).
  Crash recovery reproduces the exact state: checkpoint VOCAB + per-document
  folding during WAL replay, with `refit` journaling a full snapshot
  (`VOCAB_UPDATE`, EMB-032) after its re-upsert batches.
  `Database::register_embedder(name, embedder)` registers per-instance custom
  providers (EMB-011): built-in names are rejected, and collections reopened
  before registration defer — open succeeds, vector reads/searches work, text
  operations fail with `UnsupportedProvider` naming the remedy; registering
  binds them (EMB-023 mechanism, shared with `fastembed:*` on non-onnx
  builds). New `svd` provider behind the `svd` feature (vendored from the
  server; ndarray replaced by a plain Vec matrix, zero new deps). A server
  parity corpus (fixtures generated from the unmodified Vectorizer provider
  sources) pins bm25/tfidf/bow/char_ngram outputs within 1e-5 (acceptance 1).
  Also: small live sets (<= 256) now always search by exact brute force —
  faster than a graph traversal there and immune to tiny-graph approximation.
- Runtime payload indexes + filtered-search planner (task `phase3e`, SPEC-006
  FLT-020/030/031): `Collection::create_payload_index(key, kind)` declares an
  index late, backfilling from the live payloads; the declaration is journaled
  (`PIDX_DECLARE`, WAL op 8 — replayed after a crash) and sealed as a PIDX
  segment at checkpoint, so creation-time and runtime declarations now both
  survive reopen (previously declarations were silently dropped on reload).
  `CollectionStats.payload_indexes` reports the declared set. Filtered search
  now runs through a selectivity planner: exact pre-filter over the index
  candidate set when selective (≤ ¼ of live), HNSW over-fetch post-filter with
  adaptive growth otherwise, and an exact-scan fallback whenever the graph
  under-returns — property-tested identical to the scan baseline on every
  strategy.
- mmap primary read path + larger-than-RAM tier (task `phase2f`, ADR-0004,
  SPEC-002 STG-004/063/064): collections whose VECTORS exceed 64 MiB (or with
  `OpenOptions::mmap(true)`) keep their vector bytes in a read-only file map —
  stride addressing, no decode, per-body CRC verified once. Under the new
  `OpenOptions::memory_budget` (default 4 GiB) the HNSW graph is rebuilt from
  the map in bounded chunks on open; over it the collection serves **exact**
  SIMD brute-force k-NN straight from the map. Writes overlay the mapped base;
  unmutated mapped collections are carried forward by segment reference at
  checkpoint (O(TOC), nothing rewritten); vacuum rebases the map before the
  file swap (Windows-safe). ADR-0004 supersedes ADR-0003 — no graph
  persistence in v1 (hnsw_rs's on-disk format is version-unstable and
  directory-shaped); the byte format is untouched and the v1 freeze holds.
- Cargo workspace bootstrap (`crates/veclite`), edition 2024, provisional MSRV 1.85,
  workspace lints denying `unwrap`/`expect` in library code (task `phase0a`, DAG T0.1/T0.3).
- `VecLiteError` with the full stable variant set and pinned display strings (SPEC-004 §6).
- `CollectionOptions`, `OpenOptions`, `Metric`, `Quantization`, `Compression`,
  `Durability`, `PayloadIndexKind`, `HnswOptions` with server-parity defaults
  (SPEC-004 §3), covered by defaults-table unit tests.
- CI: wasm32-unknown-unknown build check, network-crate deny-list (NFR-08),
  and MSRV build job (`veclite-checks.yml`), alongside the existing
  3-OS test and lint workflows.
- `.editorconfig` (4-space indentation) and Rust entries in `.gitignore`.
- In-memory engine `VecLite::memory()`: collection registry over `DashMap`
  (`create_collection`/`collection`/`delete_collection`/`rename_collection`/
  `list_collections` with `AlreadyExists`/`CollectionNotFound` semantics and
  stale-handle guards) and vector CRUD (`upsert`/`upsert_batch`/`get`/`delete`/
  `delete_batch`/`len`) with dimension and NaN/Inf rejection and cosine ingest
  normalization; `Send + Sync + Clone` handles (task `phase1a`, DAG T1.1/T1.5,
  SPEC-001 §3–4, SPEC-004 §1/§4, CORE-010..014/020..022/050/051).
- `Point`, `SparseVector`, and `Hit` data-model types with id and
  collection-name validation (CORE-010/011).
- HNSW index over the pinned `hnsw_rs =0.3.4`, adapted from the server's
  `optimized_hnsw` and generalized to Cosine/Euclidean with static enum
  dispatch, per-collection `m`/`ef_construction` bounds (CORE-031),
  soft-delete tombstones + search-time over-fetch (CORE-032/033), `reindex()`,
  and rayon batch insert. Native-only — target-gated off wasm32 (ADR-0002,
  task `phase1b`, DAG T1.2/T1.3, SPEC-001 §5).
- Vendored quantization (SQ-8 default, scalar 4/2/1-bit, binary; product
  behind the `pq` feature) and scalar SIMD distance/quantize kernels, both
  byte-identical to `vectorizer-core@3.5.0` (CORE-040..043/001). Fixes the
  upstream SQ `deserialize_params` offset-restore bug without changing the
  serialized shape. Recall gates pass: HNSW top-10 ≥ 0.95, SQ-8 vs
  unquantized ≥ 0.99.
- Public search API (task `phase1c`, DAG T1.4, SPEC-004 §4–5): `Collection::search(vector, limit)`
  and the `query()` builder (`limit` default 10, per-query `ef_search`,
  `with_payload` default true, `with_vector` default false, and a declared
  `filter` slot for phase3a). Results are ordered per metric (CORE-035):
  descending similarity for Cosine/DotProduct, ascending distance for
  Euclidean. Cosine/Euclidean use the HNSW index; DotProduct and any metric on
  wasm32 use exact brute force. Builders hold no lock until `run()` (API-030);
  `limit = 0` → `InvalidArgument`, `limit` above the live count returns all
  live (API-031).
- Benchmark + server-parity gate G1 (task `phase1d`, DAG T1.6/T1.7, SPEC-015 §4–5):
  criterion benches (`benches/veclite_bench.rs`: search p50 ≈ 0.92 ms at
  2k×512, index build, batch insert), a server-parity harness
  (`tests/parity.rs`) that loads an identical corpus into VecLite and a pinned
  `hivehub/vectorizer:3.5.0` container and asserts **top-10 overlap ≥ 0.99**
  (measured 0.9920), a CI smoke-bench workflow with a ±20 % regression fence
  plus nightly full bench, and the reference hardware profile in
  [docs/benchmarks.md](docs/benchmarks.md). The harness is gated on
  `VECLITE_PARITY_URL` (no server needed for a normal `cargo test`) and uses a
  dependency-free HTTP client so no network crate enters the shipped build
  (NFR-08).

- `.veclite` on-disk format v1 storage layer (task `phase2a`, DAG T2.1/T2.2,
  SPEC-002 §1–5, native-only — gated off wasm32 per CORE-004): the fixed 4 KiB
  header with `header_crc32` and `min_reader_version` gate; the immutable
  segment codec (32-byte header, per-segment crc32 naming `segment@<offset>` on
  mismatch, LZ4/zstd bodies vendored for `.vecdb` byte-compat, VECTORS never
  compressed); all nine segment bodies (CONFIG/PAYLOAD/PIDX/CONFIG via
  MessagePack, TOMBSTONE/PIDX via 64-bit roaring, VECTORS fixed-stride with
  mmap slot addressing, IDDIR xxhash64 hash-bucketed directory, SPARSE, VOCAB,
  HNSW); the MessagePack TOC with a generation counter and deterministic replay
  order (STG-041); and the root-pointer-swap commit protocol —
  segments→fsync→TOC→fsync→header→fsync (STG-050). Property round-trips, decode
  fuzz (arbitrary bytes never panic), and a commit-crash-sequence test (a torn
  tail beyond the committed header leaves the previous TOC valid) all pass.
- Durable single-file database: `VecLite::open(path)` / `open_with(path, opts)`
  and `db.checkpoint()` (task `phase2b`, DAG T2.3/T2.4, SPEC-003, native-only).
  The `<db>.veclite-wal` sidecar logs every mutation (8 op types, MessagePack
  bodies) with a uuid-prefix stale-sidecar guard; the three `Durability` modes
  wire into every write (`Full` fsyncs each append). A checkpoint seals the
  live state into segments via the commit protocol then truncates the WAL after
  the header-swap fsync (WAL-031/032); it triggers on the WAL size limit,
  `checkpoint()`, or last-handle drop. Recovery replays a non-clean WAL in seq
  order, discarding a torn tail and applying entries idempotently
  (WAL-040..042). Verified end-to-end: checkpoint→reopen with rebuilt HNSW
  search, crash→WAL-replay equals a model over 200 random ops with interleaved
  checkpoints, delete/rename durability, torn-tail recovery, and the stale-WAL
  guard.
- Single-writer safety and read-only open (task `phase2c`, DAG T2.6/T2.9,
  SPEC-002 §6, native-only). Open takes an advisory lock on the database file's
  own handle — exclusive for read-write, shared for read-only (`fs4`) — so a
  second opener of a locked file fails immediately with `Locked` instead of
  blocking or corrupting (STG-060). `OpenOptions::read_only(true)` serves reads
  and searches but rejects every mutation with `ReadOnly`, and refuses to open
  over a pending (uncheckpointed) WAL with `WalPending` unless
  `read_only_ignore_wal(true)` opts into reading the last checkpoint (STG-062,
  WAL-043). Both open modes tolerate a damaged tail beyond the committed TOC,
  reading the last committed state (STG-003). Covered by four integration
  tests (lock conflict, read-only read/write matrix, WalPending guard,
  damaged-tail in both modes).
- Snapshot, vacuum, and auto-vacuum (task `phase2d`, DAG T2.7/T2.8,
  SPEC-002 §7, native-only). `db.snapshot(path)` writes a standalone compacted
  copy with a fresh `file_uuid` — dead space and tombstones dropped — from the
  in-memory live state, so a concurrent writer keeps going without failure
  (STG-070); it works for in-memory databases too. `db.vacuum()` reclaims dead
  space: it compacts every collection in memory (dropping tombstoned slots and
  renumbering to `0..live`), rewrites the file to a single compacted generation
  with the **same** `file_uuid`, and shrinks it via a crash-safe
  close→rename→reopen swap (STG-071). A checkpoint escalates to a vacuum once a
  collection's tombstone ratio crosses `OpenOptions::auto_vacuum_threshold`
  (default 0.25, STG-072). Verified: snapshot-under-write standalone
  consistency, file shrink after a 50 % delete with the pager still live for
  further writes, and the auto-vacuum escalation threshold.
- Crash-safety gate G2 and format v1 freeze (task `phase2e`, DAG T2.10,
  SPEC-015 §2, NFR-05/NFR-11). A crash suite (`crates/veclite/tests/crash_safety.rs`)
  runs randomized upsert/delete/checkpoint workloads in all three durability
  modes with an oracle model (TST-010), a torn-WAL-tail sweep and a WAL bit-flip
  sweep (TST-011/012, WAL-011), a torn main-file tail check (STG-003), and
  whole-file bit-flip drills (TST-012) — every reopen matches the model or fails
  cleanly with `Corrupt`, never a panic or a silently wrong answer. Iteration
  count scales via `VECLITE_CRASH_ITERS`. `cargo xtask crash` (new `xtask` crate,
  SPEC-015 §7) runs the suite at 10 000 iterations plus a **real subprocess
  kill-9 harness** that SIGKILL/TerminateProcess-es a live `Full`-durability
  writer at random points and verifies every acked commit survives the reopen.
  The suite runs nightly on Linux/macOS/Windows (`veclite-crash.yml`, TST-013).
  Committed v1 golden files (`crates/veclite/tests/compat/golden/`) are guarded
  on every run (`tests/golden.rs`), and **SPEC-002/SPEC-003 are now
  frozen-normative**: the on-disk byte format is fixed; changes require a new
  format version (NFR-11).
- Payload filters (task `phase3a`, DAG T3.1–T3.3, SPEC-006). A Qdrant-style
  filter model — `Filter { must, should, must_not }` over `Condition::{Eq, In,
  Range, Exists, Nested}` with `MatchValue`/`Range` — with server-parity
  combination and type semantics (FLT-010/011): `must` AND, `should` OR (when
  non-empty), `must_not` NAND; integer/float JSON-number equality; `Range` on
  numerics only; `Exists` = key presence (matches `null`). Filters are built in
  Rust or parsed from a portable JSON document (`Filter::from_json`); geo
  conditions and nested-path keys are rejected with `InvalidArgument`, never
  ignored (FLT-012). `Collection::query(v).filter(f)` applies them. Payload
  indexes (`Keyword`/`Integer`/`Float`) declared via `CollectionOptions::
  payload_index` build roaring-bitmap `value → slots` maps that pre-filter
  selective queries; they are accelerators only — results are identical to a
  payload scan (FLT-022) and the index rebuilds from payloads on open. Top-level
  `_`-prefixed payload keys are reserved (FLT-002) and payloads over 16 MiB are
  rejected. Covered by a conformance corpus, index/scan-equivalence, pre-filter
  vs brute-force, reserved-key, and unsupported-feature tests (`tests/filters.rs`,
  gate G3 criteria 1–5).
- Text embeddings & auto-embed collections (task `phase3b`, DAG T3.5/T3.6,
  SPEC-005). An `Embedder` trait and four pure-Rust sparse providers vendored
  from the server (ADR-0001) with identical scoring math for parity (EMB-002):
  `bm25` (default; `k1=1.5`, `b=0.75`), `tfidf`, `bow`, and `char_ngram`
  (typo-tolerant trigrams); `veclite::build_provider(name, dim)` fails with
  `UnsupportedProvider` on an unknown name (EMB-021). `CollectionOptions::
  auto_embed(provider, dim)` collections accept `upsert_text`/`search_text`:
  the text is embedded and stored under the reserved `_text` key (EMB-022), and
  the vocabulary is a function of the live `_text` corpus — recomputed lazily
  before search and rebuilt from `_text` on reopen (like the HNSW graph), so
  `search_text` is reopen-identical (EMB-020) with no VOCAB segment yet. Text
  ops on a BYO collection and reserved user keys are rejected. A deterministic,
  UTF-8-safe `veclite::chunk::Chunker` (word/sentence boundaries, overlap;
  EMB-050/051) rounds it out. Covered by provider unit tests, a chunker UTF-8
  fuzz, and `tests/auto_embed.rs`.
- Hybrid dense+sparse search with RRF fusion (task `phase3c`, DAG T3.4/T3.7,
  SPEC-007). `SparseVector` gains validation (strictly increasing indices,
  matching lengths, finite values — HYB-001) and a shared-term-space dot
  product; `Collection::search_sparse` ranks the BYO sparse lane. The
  `hybrid_query()` builder fuses the dense and sparse lanes with reciprocal rank
  fusion (§3): each lane fetches `max(limit×4, 100)` candidates and the fused
  score is `alpha/(rrf_k + rank_dense) + (1−alpha)/(rrf_k + rank_sparse)` (an
  absent lane contributes 0), ordered by fused score then dense rank then
  bytewise id — fully deterministic (defaults `alpha=0.5`, `rrf_k=60`,
  HYB-020/021). A single provided lane degenerates to that lane's plain search
  with its own scores (HYB-010); the payload filter applies to both lanes
  (HYB-011); an auto-embed collection rejects an explicit sparse vector
  (HYB-002). Covered by `tests/hybrid.rs` (validation, degeneration equivalence,
  determinism, fused ordering, filtered hybrid).
- API surface: aliases, scroll, batch search, stats (task `phase3d`, DAG
  T3.8–T3.10, SPEC-004 §2/§4). `create_alias`/`delete_alias`/`aliases()` add
  transparent alias resolution to `collection(name)` for blue-green swaps
  (CORE-011) — journaled and sealed into the TOC so they survive reopen;
  deleting a collection drops its aliases and renaming re-points them.
  `Collection::scroll(after, limit, filter)` paginates live points in stable
  slot order, covering every live vector exactly once, with optional filtering
  (API-022 / FLT-032). `search_batch` runs many queries in parallel (rayon on
  native, serial on wasm; FR-35), and `stats()` reports live/tombstone counts
  and dimension (FR-08/13). The text-first API (`upsert_text`/`search_text`) and
  the chunker landed earlier in `phase3b`. Covered by `tests/api.rs`.
- C ABI core (`veclite-ffi` crate, task `phase4a`, DAG T4.1/T4.2, SPEC-008). A
  handle-based C ABI (cdylib + staticlib): every entry point is wrapped in
  `catch_unwind` → `VL_ERR_INTERNAL` with a thread-local last-error message
  (FFI-003/020), so a panic never unwinds across the boundary. Error codes are
  1:1 with `VecLiteError` via a new exhaustive `VecLiteError::ffi_code()` (adding
  a variant without a code fails the build — acceptance 3). Structured data
  crosses as JSON or MessagePack per a codec flag; vectors as `(*const f32,
  len)`; library objects freed only by the matching `vl_*_free`. The core
  surface covers lifecycle, collections, aliases, writes, `get`/`search`/
  `search_text`, borrowed result views, and version/error meta. Five Rust-side
  tests drive the `extern "C"` functions as a C caller would. The cbindgen golden
  header, the `cargo public-api` freeze snapshot, the remaining functions, and
  the ASan/TSan C tests are tracked in `phase4g`.
- Python binding (`veclite-py` crate, task `phase4b`, DAG T4.3, SPEC-009). A
  PyO3 binding on the Rust core, built by maturin as an **abi3 wheel** (one
  wheel for CPython 3.9+, no Rust toolchain to install — PY-001).
  `Database`/`Collection` mirror the Rust surface in snake_case; payloads and
  filters cross as Python dicts. **NumPy zero-copy** (PY-020..022): `search`
  borrows a C-contiguous `float32` array and `upsert_batch` reads an `(n, dim)`
  array row-by-row with no intermediate Python-list copy (lists still work). The
  **GIL is released** around every core call (PY-030). Every `VecLiteError`
  variant surfaces as a dedicated subclass of `veclite.VecLiteError` with the
  identical Rust message (PY-040). Covered by 8 pytest tests (quickstart, numpy
  batch/query, filtered search, exception fidelity, auto-embed text, aliases,
  hybrid). The crate is excluded from the Rust workspace, so the pure-Rust CI is
  unaffected; `register_embedder`, `veclite.aio`, and the wheel CI matrix are
  tracked in `phase4h`.

### Fixed
- **Small-collection search recall** (phase3a): searches now return exact,
  correctly ordered results when the live set is no larger than the requested
  count, and fall back to exact brute force whenever the HNSW index
  under-returns — `search` always yields `min(limit, live)` results (previously
  a tiny/approximate graph could drop the farthest candidate).
- **WAL entry integrity** (phase2e): the per-entry CRC now covers the fixed
  header fields (`seq`/`coll_id`/`op`/`body_len`) in addition to the body, so a
  bit flip in a header field is detected and terminates replay at the torn tail
  (WAL-011) instead of silently misrouting or dropping the entry. Closed before
  the format freeze.
- **Decode OOM** (phase2e): `IdDir::decode` bounded its bucket pre-allocation by
  the input length, so an adversarial `bucket_count` no longer triggers a
  multi-GiB allocation (decode-fuzz could abort with an out-of-memory on
  arbitrary bytes — a corrupt file must fail with `Corrupt`, never OOM).

### Changed
- **PRD OQ-1 resolved** (phase1d): the reference hardware profile is pinned in
  [docs/benchmarks.md](docs/benchmarks.md) — a desktop AMD Ryzen 9 7950X3D class
  and an AWS `c7a.4xlarge` cloud class.
- **ADR-0001**: VecLite has zero dependency on Vectorizer crates. The originally
  planned `vectorizer-core` dependency (unpublished; mandatory network deps conflict
  with NFR-08) is replaced by a vendoring policy — needed code is copied into this
  repo with provenance headers, byte-identical encodings enforced by the conformance
  corpus. Quantization/SIMD land with `phase1b`, compression with `phase2a`.
- **ADR-0003** (phase2c): memory-mapped larger-than-RAM reads (STG-004) and
  HNSW-graph persistence (STG-063) are deferred while `hnsw_rs =0.3.4` is the
  index — it keeps a full f32 copy of every vector in RAM (so mmap gives no
  larger-than-RAM benefit) and has no stable graph serialization (so the graph
  is rebuilt from vectors on every open). Both are tracked in
  `phase2f_mmap-hnsw-persistence`, gated on an index-strategy decision.
- **MSRV raised to 1.87** (phase2e, REL-002): edition 2024 floors at 1.85, but
  the pinned `hnsw_rs =0.3.4` (CORE-030) uses `is_multiple_of` (stable in 1.87),
  so 1.87 is the true minimum. `Cargo.toml` `rust-version`, SPEC-016 REL-002,
  and the MSRV CI job updated accordingly.
- **vacuum mechanism** (phase2d): v1 `vacuum()` shrinks via a compacted
  temp-file + atomic close→rename→reopen swap (SQLite-VACUUM style) rather than
  the in-place append-then-truncate of SPEC-002 STG-071. This is crash-safe and
  Windows-safe without an active memory map; the STG-071 "unmap→truncate→remap"
  in-place variant only becomes relevant once mmap lands, and is tracked in
  `phase2f_mmap-hnsw-persistence` alongside the active-mmap vacuum test (was
  phase2d 2.3).
